Put any notes for us here (If you feel you need to explain how / why you did something the way you did):
I threw in bootstrap and reactstrap to help with the modal form layout. 
My intention was to use it for styling, but I did relatively little in the way of css work due to the time limit.

Part IV would have been relatively easy to implement in another hour, but I didn't want to drag the time out further. 
I felt that Part V would have been more involved.

I installed typescript to make the code a little more familiar, but the changes are minor and the concepts are the same.

I am used to VisualStudio, but took this as a challenge and learning experience to do everything outside of VS as I wanted to make sure I used this code base without risking it getting muddied up with a template of my own.

I enjoyed the exercise and wish I had more time!

And sorry- I just read the comment about commiting often and early, which I failed to do! So you should only see one commit from me.
